        <strong>Project number one: </strong>
      </span> 
      This was my first ever crochet project! I made it three years ago while I had an internship at an activity center for people with special needs. 
      <br> Most people there knew how to crochet or knit, so I got a lot of help from everybody. My supervisor even freestyled a pattern for me. 
      I think I did great considering it was my first time, 
      <br> 
      I especially like the leaf on top of his head!</p>

      <strong>Project number two: </strong>
    </span>
    This is a jellyfish that I like to crochet because it's small and easy to make. I also like it because I think jellyfish are pretty cool. 
    <br> 
    I usually give them away to my parents or friends because I don't have any use for a pile of crocheted jellyfish. I've considered making a garland of jellyfish in the future though...

  <h2>3. The panda</h2>

      <strong>Project number three: </strong>
    </span>
    This panda is actually my most recent project that I made a few weeks ago. 
    <br> 
    I think it turned out pretty well, but unfortunaly I forgot to give it a tail and I'm not very satisfyed with the circles around the eyes. It's still cute though!
