          This was my first ever crochet project! I made it three years ago while I had an internship at an activity center for people with special needs. 
          <br> Most people there knew how to crochet or knit, so I got a lot of help from everybody. My supervisor even freestyled a pattern for me. 
          <br>I think I did great considering it was my first time, I especially like the leaf on top of his head!

          This is a jellyfish that I like to crochet because it's small and easy to make. I also like it because I think jellyfish are pretty cool. 
          <br> I usually give them away to my parents or friends because I don't have any use for a pile of crocheted jellyfish. 
          <br>I've considered making a garland of jellyfish in the future though...

          This panda is actually my most recent project that I made a few weeks ago. 
          <br> I think it turned out pretty well, but unfortunaly I forgot to give it a tail and I'm not very satisfyed with the circles around the eyes. 
          <br> It's still cute though!
